Template Engine Employee Summary

This application takes in employees information and generates a webpage that displays summaries for each person. The user can input as many team members as they like, the employees can be titled as managers, engineers, or interns. When finised the application will create a neatly displayed HTML file that displays all of the team members based on the information entered by the user.
